// please declare an enumeration for the different array indices that are 
//relevant to your program (e.g., the program name which is at position 0 in argv, the 
//input file name which should be given at position 1 in argv, and the expected number of 
//command line arguments including the program name, which is given by argc).


//declare an enumeration for the different success and failure values your program can return 
//i.e., 0 for success and different non-zero values for all the different kinds of failures the program may encounter).
