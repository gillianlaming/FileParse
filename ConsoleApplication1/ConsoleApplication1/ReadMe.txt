1. Errors encountered over in process:


2. Test cases ran (i.e., what the command lines were), and summary 
of what prgram did and whether that was correct behavior.

Things to note in code:
-  Every program should have a helpful "usage" message. 
It should be printed out if erroneous command line arguments (or too many or too few) are provided 
to the program, and should show the correct format for command line arguments.
