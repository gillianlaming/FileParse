Gillian Laming, Lab 1

1. Errors encountered over in process:
- 'parsingFunction': Lab1 identifier not found
- no suitable conversion function from "std::string" to "int" exists, mismatched type error	

2. Test cases ran (i.e., what the command lines were), and summary 
of what prgram did and whether that was correct behavior.
- Command Lines run:
Lab1.exe input_file.txt
output from that command line was:

I also ran echo %errorlevel%, which return 0 which indicated success.
